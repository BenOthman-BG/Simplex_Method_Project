# Méthode Simplex Project

## 📌 Introduction
**Méthode_simplex_project** is an educational application designed to implement the **Simplex Method**, a fundamental algorithm used in **Operations Research (OR)**.

The application allows users to automatically find the **optimal solution** of a linear programming problem by simply entering the required data. All computation and resolution steps are handled internally by the system.

This project was developed as part of a **university mini-project**, aiming to reinforce theoretical knowledge of **Operations Research** through practical implementation.

## 🎯 Project Description
This application enables users to:
- Define the objective function
- Enter system constraints
- Automatically compute the optimal solution using the **Simplex Method**
- Better understand the Simplex algorithm through a practical and interactive tool

The project is mainly intended for students and anyone interested in learning or revising the **Simplex Method** in a simple and intuitive way.
